Instructions on running the code-



1. This contains a 'ReadCertificate.java' source code file, 3 certificate files and 1 README.txt file. Place all these files and place them in the home directory.



2. Make sure that all the 3 certificate files are in the home directory only and no where else, as the java code reads them from the home directory of the Linux user.



3. Run the 'ReadCertificate.java' file in the terminal.



4. I display the information from the certificates in the following order-

	-Verifying Raghu's certificate.

	-Printing Ragh's certificate.

	-Printing Raghu's public and private keys.
	
-Printing public key of the CA.
	
-Printing the signature on Raghu's certificate.

	-Encrypting and Decrypting the string "My name is Omkar Totade."



5. It generates a pair of private and public keys for encryption and decryption. I encrypt the above string using the private key and decrypt it with the public key. 


6. The public and private keys used are created by the program and are placed in the home directory too, by the names 'private.key' and 'public.key'.
